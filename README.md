# :rocket: Weathers Tech Portolio
I build intelligent applications and the secure, scalable systems that power them. My work spans from FastAPI-driven Machine Learning deployment to Systems Engineering and Infrastructure hardening.

Core Expertise:

  **Backend & ML:**
  * Designing APIs and deploying models for real-time inference.

  **Systems & Security:**
  * Virtualization, Infrastructure as Code principles, and System Hardening.

  **Data Manipulation:**
  * Advanced analysis and automated ETL workflows.
