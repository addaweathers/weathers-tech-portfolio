Overview - These are screenshots captured while completing a school assignment where I was instructed to create a model to predict diabetes using this dataset. 

This branch consists of screenshots that outline the data cleaning and transformation process using SQL before creation of a random forest and logistic regression model. Both models fail, as this dataset fails to capture clinical relevance to diabetes diagnosis. 

However, this assignment presented an invaluable opportunity to practice data analysis techniques.
